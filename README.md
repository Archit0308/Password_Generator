# Password_Generator
A password generator is a tool that creates random, complex passwords that are difficult for hackers to crack.

Password generators typically use algorithms to generate strings of characters that include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

When creating a password, it's important to use a combination of these characters to make the password as secure as possible. A password generator can do this automatically, making it easy for users to create strong passwords without having to come up with them on their own.

Some password generators also allow users to specify the length and complexity of the password they want to generate. This can be helpful in creating passwords that meet specific requirements, such as those for online banking or email accounts.
